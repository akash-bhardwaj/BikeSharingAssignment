## General Information
- In this project we have used Linear Regression Modelling technique to predict the demand of Bike Shraing sales for the company.
- We need to come up with a Linear Regression Model to predict the demand of Bike Sharing that might come up when business is back to normal.
- Predict the demand of Bike Sharing sales for the company once business is back to normal, basically what all factors are more likely to effect these sales, so that the company can align its
marketing strategies accordingly to reap maximum profits.
- Dataset which was used included many factors such as temperature, humidity, date of rental, season, month, year, windspeed etc to predict the count of sales on any given day.


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis


## Technologies Used
- Python libraries such as Matplotlib(3.8.4), Seaborn(0.13.2), Numpy(1.26.4), Pandas(2.2.2), Stats Model(0.14.2), scikit-learn (1.4.2) are used.
- Analysis has been done using Jupyter Notebook(7.0.8)
